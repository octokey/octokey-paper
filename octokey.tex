\begin{abstract}
We propose Octokey, a cryptographic protocol for authenticating users, designed as a replacement for
password authentication in consumer internet use cases. Every user is associated with a public key
on the server, and clients authenticate by presenting a challenge signed with the user's private
key, similar to SSH public key authentication. We also describe protocols which allow users to log
in to their accounts on multiple devices, provision new devices, and revoke keys on devices that are
lost or stolen.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have introduced the design of Octokey, an authentication system intended for
consumer internet use cases. We argue that it provides better security than all commonly-used
alternatives (passwords, password managers, and federated authentication methods), and provides a
better user experience and better flexibility than more secure alternatives (hardware-based
authenticators, smart cards).

Octokey builds on mature, well-understood components such as TLS and RSA, and has similarities to
the familiar SSH public key authentication protocol. By keeping the new algorithms to a minimum, and
by using familiar and mature components where possible, we hope that the security characteristics of
the system will be easily understood by users and implementers.

It is quite simple for service owners to start accepting Octokey as an authentication mechanism,
since libraries for verifying PKCS\#1 signatures are available for all common programming languages.
Octokey can also be used alongside passwords or other authentication mechanisms, allowing it to be
adopted gradually. It does not require any special hardware or any changes to the way online
services are deployed.

Most of the complexity of Octokey lies in the implementation of the client applications and the
mediator service. We plan to develop these using an entirely open source model, and to make them
available as free software for anyone to run and modify. The protocols should be open standards, and
anybody should be free to create alternative implementations if they wish.

Octokey strikes a pragmatic compromise between security and convenience, and strives for a very
simple user experience with minimal risk of user error. We hope that it can be the viable
alternative to passwords that has eluded us for so long. We invite others to join the project, give
feedback, spread the word, and start working towards a real implementation.
